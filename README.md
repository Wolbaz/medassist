This is just a brief description

### ⚠️ Disclamer 

- Your health is your responsibility. Take it seriously and don’t rely on any app—especially not this one! I don't have a medical or programming degree; this app is made with love, so it may contain some serious flaws.

- Follow your doctor’s instructions closely, keep track of your medication supply, and plan ahead for reordering.

- Think of this app as a helpful tool, but make all health decisions independently!

## Demo

You can try application here: [Demo](https://volimandr.eu)

Application doesn't have login and I'm not sure what to expect security wise, but that domain and server are not being used for anything else right now. It's running in docker container behind Nginx Proxy Manager. I might clear databse from time to time, but feel free to play around.
